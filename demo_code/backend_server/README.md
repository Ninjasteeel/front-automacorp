# Usage 

## Install dependencies

Run the command 

```
npm install
```

## Init or reinitialize the database

Run the command

```
npm run db:init
```

You should run this command the first time you use this repo in order to create the sample dataset (file `data.json`). You may run this command anytime
in order to reset your dataset to the initial sample dataset.

## Start the API server

Run the command 

```
npm run start
```

This will start an HTTP server on http://localhost:3014. You can now access the API on that URL. See the API documentation for details on endpoints.
